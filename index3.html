    <h1>How to Play</h1>
    <p>
      In this game, you must move the balls to arrange them according to the
      color of the ball, within a certain period of time. (For example, I want
      to move the blue ball with the rest of the blue balls into a specific
      tube)
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first picture, balls appear randomly in the tubes. You must choose
      a suitable ball and move it to a missing or empty tube. In this example,
      the pink ball was chosen and transferred to an empty tube.
    </p>

      />
      <p>
        In the second picture, the pink ball has been moved to be above the
        other pink ball. The goal of this is to complete a tube with one ball's
        colors!

      />
      <p>
        In the third picture, as is clear, we were able to take the purple ball!
        Which means that we will move it to complete a tube containing only
        purple cores!
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        In the fourth picture, after completing the transfer of the purple ball,
        the tube and all the purple balls were completed! Now we must move the
        pink ball to complete the second tube!
      </p>

      <p>
        When you complete all the balls with one color in all the tubes! The
        game is completed
